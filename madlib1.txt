our school cafeteria has really domed food. just thinkin about it makes my stomach rake. the spaghetti is stringed and tastes like tools. one day i swear 1 of my meatballs started to squirm. the turkey tacos are totally bum and look kind of like old husks. my friend dana actually likes the meatloaf, even thought its tame and clean. i call it "mystery meatloaf", and think its really made out of choir. my dad said he make my lunches, but the first day he made me a sandwich out of prisms and peanut butter! i think id rather take my chances with the cafeteria!
