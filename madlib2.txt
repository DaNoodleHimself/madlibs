i cant belive its already christmas. i cant wait to put on my grapes and visit every rag in my neighborhood. this year i am going to dress up as a mom with eyes. before i roar i make sure to grab my eight lice to hold all my juice. finally all my slacks are ready to go. when Obama answers the door, i say "Poop or treat". yum. i got a bagel and a macaron. we visit 21 houses and decide its time to yield home. my cousin says if i eat too much mangos, my brain will hurt, so ill just eat 10987654321 pieces and go straight to bed. i hope ill have pale dreams of vomiting tonight!
Happy HAnukkah!
